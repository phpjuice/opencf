PHP implementation of the (Weighted Slopeone,Cosine, Weighted Cosine) rating-based collaborative filtering schemes.

## Installation

OpenCF Package requires `PHP 7.4` or higher.

> **INFO:** If you are using an older version of php this package will not function correctly.

The supported way of installing `OpenCF` package is via Composer.

```bash
composer require phpjuice/opencf
```

## Usage

OpenCF Package is designed to be very simple and straightforward to use. All you have to do is:

1. Load a training set (dataset)
3. Predict future ratings using a recommender. (Weighted Slopeone,Cosine, Weighted Cosine)

### Create Recommender Service

The `OpenCF` recommender service is created by direct instantiation:

```php
use OpenCF\RecommenderService;

// Create an instance
$recommenderService = new RecommenderService($dataset);
```

### Adding dataset

Adding a dataset to the recommender can be done using the constructor or can be easily done by providing an array of
users ratings via the `setDataset()` method:

```php
$dataset = [
    "squid" => [
        "user1" => 1,
        "user2" => 1,
        "user3" => 0.2,
    ],
    "cuttlefish" => [
        "user1" => 0.5,
        "user3" => 0.4,
        "user4" => 0.9,
    ],
    "octopus" => [
        "user1" => 0.2,
        "user2" => 0.5,
        "user3" => 1,
        "user4" => 0.4,
    ],
    "nautilus" => [
        "user2" => 0.2,
        "user3" => 0.4,
        "user4" => 0.5,
    ],
];

$recommenderService->setDataset($dataset);
```

### Getting Predictions

All you have to do to predict ratings for a new user is to retrieve an engine from the recommender service and & run
the `predict()` method.

```php
// Get a recommender
$recommender = $recommenderService->cosine(); // Cosine recommender
// OR
$recommender = $recommenderService->weightedCosine(); // WeightedCosine recommender
// OR
$recommender = $recommenderService->weightedSlopeone(); // WeightedSlopeone recommender

// Predict future ratings
$results = $recommender->predict([
    "squid" => 0.4
]);
```

This should produce the following results when using `WeightedSlopeone` recommender

```php
[
  "cuttlefish" => 0.25,
  "octopus" => 0.23,
  "nautilus" => 0.1
];
```

## Running the tests

you can easily run tests using composer

```bash
$ composer test
```
